**CITATION:** Data Skills Teaching Data Subsets, NEON; Wasser, Leah; Jones, Megan A. (2016): 
NEON Spatio-temporal Teaching Data Subset. figshare. Fileset. https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.2009586.v10 

The data and lessons in this workshop were originally developed through a hackathon supported by the 
[National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON)](https://www.neonscience.org/) - an NSF funded observatory in Boulder, Colorado. 
NEON is collecting data for 30 years to help scientists understand
how our aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems are changing. The data used in these lessons cover two NEON field sites:
* Harvard Forest (HARV) - Massachusetts, USA - [fieldsite description](https://www.neonscience.org/field-sites/field-sites-map/HARV)
* San Joachin Experimental Range (SJER) - California, USA - [fieldsite description](https://www.neonscience.org/field-sites/field-sites-map/SJER)
 
You can download all of the data used in this workshop by clicking 
[this download link](https://ndownloader.figshare.com/articles/2009586/versions/10). 
Clicking the download link will automatically download all of the files to your default download directory as a single compressed
(`.zip`) file. To expand this file, double click the folder icon in your file navigator application (for Macs, this is the Finder 
application).
 
These data files represent teaching version of the data, with sufficient complexity to teach many aspects of  data analysis and 
management, but with many complexities removed to allow students to focus on the core ideas and skills being taught.  
 
 | Dataset | File name | Description |
 | ---- | ------| ---- | 
 | Site layout shapefiles | NEON-DS-Site-Layout-Files.zip | A set of shapefiles for the NEON's Harvard Forest field site and US and (some) state boundary layers. | 
 | Meteorological data |  NEON-DS-Met-Time-Series.zip | Precipitation, temperature and other variables collected from a flux tower at the NEON Harvard Forest site
 | Airborne remote sensing data | NEON-DS-Airborne-RemoteSensing.zip | LiDAR data collected by the NEON Airborne Observation Platform (AOP) and processed at NEON including a canopy height model, digital elevation model and digital surface model for NEON's Harvard Forest and San Joaquin Experimental Range field sites. | 
 | Landstat 7 NDVI raster data | NEON-DS-Landsat-NDVI.zip | 2011 NDVI data product derived from Landsat 7 and processed by USGS cropped to NEON's Harvard Forest and San Joaquin Experimental Range field sites | 

## About the Site Layout Shapefiles
These vector data provide information on the site characterization and infrastructure at the 
[National Ecological Observatory Network's](https://www.neonscience.org/)
[Harvard Forest](https://www.neonscience.org/field-sites/field-sites-map/HARV) field site. 
The Harvard Forest shapefiles are from the [Harvard Forest GIS & Map](http://harvardforest.fas.harvard.edu/gis-maps/) archives. 
US Country and State Boundary layers are from the [US Census Bureau](https://www.census.gov/geo/maps-data/data/tiger-cart-boundary.html).

## About the Meteorological Data
The data used in this lesson were collected at the [National Ecological Observatory Network's](https://www.neonscience.org/) 
[Harvard Forest](https://www.neonscience.org/field-sites/field-sites-map/HARV). These data are proxy data for what will be available 
for 30 years on the [NEON data portal](http://data.neonscience.org/home) for the Harvard Forest and other field sites located across
the United States.

## About the Airborne Remote Sensing Data
This data was collected at the [National Ecological Observatory Network's](https://www.neonscience.org/) 
[Harvard Forest](https://www.neonscience.org/field-sites/field-sites-map/HARV) and 
[San Joaquin Experimental Range](https://www.neonscience.org/field-sites/field-sites-map/SJER) field sites. 

Airborne remote sensing flight surveys are conducted by the NEON project to collect quantitative information on land cover
and changes to ecological structure and chemistry, including the presence and effects of invasive species across landscapes 100-300km2
surrounding NEON sites. Data are collected during peak greenness at each field site and include the following: 

* DSM (Digital Surface Model; full mosaic)
* DTM (Digital Terrain Model; full mosaic)
* CHM (Canopy Height Model; full mosaic)
* RGB imagery (Harvard Forest site only)

Additional information about airborne remote sensing data, including other data types for these and other sites can
be found on [NEONâ€™s Airborne Data](https://www.neonscience.org/data-collection/airborne-remote-sensing) page.

## About the Landstat 7 NDVI Raster Data
The imagery data used to create this raster teaching data subset were collected over the 
[National Ecological Observatory Network's](https://www.neonscience.org/) 
[Harvard Forest](https://www.neonscience.org/field-sites/field-sites-map/HARV) 
and [San Joaquin Experimental Range](https://www.neonscience.org/field-sites/field-sites-map/SJER) field sites. 
The imagery was created by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) using a 
[multispectral scanner](http://eros.usgs.gov/#/Find_Data/Products_and_Data_Available/MSS) on a 
[Landsat Satellite](http://landsat.usgs.gov/). The data files are Geographic Tagged Image-File Format (GeoTIFF).
